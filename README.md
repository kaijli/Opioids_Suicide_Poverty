Impact of Opioid Prescription Rate on Suicide Rates and Poverty Levels of Counties in the United States

This project was completed by Kaitlyn Li and Qiqi Liang over Summer 2020 for the USCLAP competition's winter
entry. The work completed for this project, in addition to pre-project brainstorming is included in this 
repository. 

Abstract
Opioids continue to flood into our communities through prescriptions from doctors and dentists. In this study, 
we attempt to determine the relationship between opioid prescription rates of a county and the county’s associated 
suicide rate and poverty levels. Data was pulled from government websites and compiled into one large data set. 
The opioid prescription rate was then used as the independent variable to be compared against the other two variables 
in multiple statistical tests to see if there is a positive correlation between the three variables. All p-values were 
found to be well below our significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, all slopes were positive, and all adjusted R^2 values 
were positive as well. Our results suggest that there is a positive relationship between the three analyzed variables—if 
poverty level is fixed, increasing suicide rates still correlates with increasing opioid prescription rates and vice versa. 
We hope that this research project will bring greater social awareness to the severity of the opioid crisis and thus prompt 
greater support and resource distribution efforts at the community level.
