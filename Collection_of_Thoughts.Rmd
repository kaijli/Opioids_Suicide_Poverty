#Data is about passwords in general

passwords <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-14/passwords.csv')

# Or read in with tidytuesdayR package (https://github.com/thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR)
# PLEASE NOTE TO USE 2020 DATA YOU NEED TO UPDATE tidytuesdayR from GitHub

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

# Install via devtools::install_github("thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR")

#Potential Research Questions
#Does category of password affect the time it takes to crack password (online or offline)
#Most popular letters used in passwords

#Data gives us percentages of fatal collisions of drivers doing some illegal activity (drinking, etc.)

bad_drivers <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/bad-drivers/bad-drivers.csv')

#Potential Research Questions: 
#States with the most bad drives...this was actually a question in 538 but we can do our own statistics/graphs about it..not sure though seems like an interesting question.
#Common causes of fatal colllisions in each state

```

```{r}
#Think this one is my favorite dataset with potential for good/applicable research questions 
hate_crimes <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/hate-crimes/hate_crimes.csv')

#Potential Research Questions
#Association between household income and percentage of hate crimes
#What can the GINI Index tell us about hate crimes in an area?
#Does having a high school degree affect average median household income?

# 2008 - 2014 US Suicides Rates per 100,000 Population
# All injury, suicide, all races, all ethnicities, both sexes, all ages. annualized crude rate for united states: 12.63
# The main thing I'm looking at.

#Potential Research Questions
#Association between opioid prescription rate and suicide rate.
#Can we do an overlay of the two maps??
#Does a larger rate of legal opioid prescription cause a higher rate of overdoses and suicides?
