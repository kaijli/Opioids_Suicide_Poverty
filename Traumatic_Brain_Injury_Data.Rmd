This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# Get the Data

tbi_age <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-24/tbi_age.csv')
tbi_year <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-24/tbi_year.csv')
tbi_military <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-24/tbi_military.csv')

# Or read in with tidytuesdayR package (https://github.com/thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR)
# PLEASE NOTE TO USE 2020 DATA YOU NEED TO USE tidytuesdayR version ? from GitHub

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

# Install via devtools::install_github("thebioengineer/tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-03-24')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 13)


tbi_age <- tuesdata$tbi_age

```

```{r}
tbi_no_total <- tbi_age %>%
  filter(age_group != "Total")
```


trying out some plots

```{r}
ggplot(data=tbi_no_total, aes(x=age_group, y = number_est, fill = type)) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "Age and Type")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=tbi_no_total, aes(x=age_group, y = number_est, fill = injury_mechanism)) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "Age and Mechanism")
```
```{r}
tbi_specific_three <- tbi_age %>%
  filter(age_group != "Total" & (injury_mechanism == "Assault" | injury_mechanism == "Intentional self-harm" | injury_mechanism == "Motor Vehicle Crashes" ))
  
ggplot(data=tbi_specific_three, aes(x=age_group, y = number_est, fill = injury_mechanism)) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "Age and Mechanism")
```
To do next: clean up the age groups displayed, as there is current overlap. Try to find proportions.
